Final project for GRAD 50500 - Foundations in Data Science
This project evaluates the accuracy and reliability of the USDA Economic Research Serviceâ€™s Food Price Outlook dataset. It compares forecasted food price changes against actual Consumer Price Index (CPI) outcomes, explores forecast errors by food category, and examines long-term inflation trends from the 1970s to the present.
